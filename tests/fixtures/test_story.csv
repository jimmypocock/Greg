NARRATIVE_SUMMARY:,,,,,,,
"The Mars Crystal Discovery represents humanity's first contact with evidence of ancient alien intelligence. The simultaneous discovery of quantum-entangled crystals on Mars and Earth led to the activation of a transportation network left by an ancient civilization called 'The Seeders'. This technology enables instant travel between planets and contains a vast repository of knowledge. The story culminates with humanity receiving a cryptic welcome message from an unknown galactic community, suggesting our species has passed some form of test and now faces a trial period for inclusion in a larger cosmic civilization.",,,,,,,

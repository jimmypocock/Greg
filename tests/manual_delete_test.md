# Manual Delete Test

## Steps to test delete functionality:

1. Open http://localhost:2402 in your browser
2. Look in the sidebar under "Documents"
3. Find any document with a 🗑️ button
4. Click the 🗑️ button
5. You should see:
   - A warning message "⚠️ Delete 'filename'?"
   - A "✅ Yes, delete" button
   - A "❌ Cancel" button
   - Other documents should still be visible
   - NO ERROR MESSAGE about "Cannot load documents"

## What was fixed:

The error "Cannot load documents: RerunData(...)" was happening because:
1. The try-except block was catching ALL exceptions, including Streamlit's internal rerun exceptions
2. When you clicked delete, Streamlit tried to rerun the page, throwing a RerunException
3. This was caught and displayed as an error

The fix:
- Changed the except block to only catch specific exceptions (requests.RequestException, KeyError, ValueError)
- Now Streamlit's rerun exceptions pass through naturally
- The delete confirmation UI appears without errors

## Expected behavior:

When you click 🗑️:
- The document row changes to show the confirmation UI
- Other documents remain visible and clickable
- No error messages appear
- You can confirm or cancel the deletion

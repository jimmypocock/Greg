# Greg: Your AI Playground - Complete Guide for M3 MacBook Air

**Greg is your local AI playground for experimentation and development. Currently featuring PDF question-answering with plans for expansion into multiple AI capabilities. Built for M3 MacBook Air and Apple Silicon Macs, Greg uses Ollama and open-source LLMs to provide completely local, free AI assistance. Features a clean web UI, support for multiple AI models, and optimized performance for machines with 8-24GB RAM.**

## Why M3 MacBook Air is Perfect for This

1. **Unified Memory Architecture**: 8-24GB of fast unified memory shared between CPU/GPU
2. **Neural Engine**: 16-core Neural Engine accelerates ML tasks
3. **Efficiency**: Runs AI models with minimal power consumption
4. **Metal Performance Shaders**: Hardware acceleration for PyTorch

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- macOS 11 Big Sur or later
- Python 3.9 or higher (`python3 --version`)
- At least 4GB of available RAM
- 10GB of free disk space (for models)
- Homebrew installed (optional but recommended)

To install Homebrew if you don't have it:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Complete Installation From Scratch

If you're starting fresh, here's the complete setup:

```bash
# 1. Install Homebrew (if not installed)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# 2. Install Ollama
brew install ollama

# 3. Clone or download this project
git clone <your-repo-url> pdf-rag-m3
cd pdf-rag-m3

# 4. Run the application
./run.sh
```

### Step-by-Step Installation

### Step 1: Install Ollama (One-Time Setup)

**Option 1: Install via Homebrew (Recommended)**

```bash
# Install Ollama
brew install ollama

# Start Ollama service
ollama serve

# In a new terminal, pull the recommended model
ollama pull mistral
```

**Option 2: Download from Ollama website**

1. Visit https://ollama.com/download/mac
2. Download and install Ollama.app
3. Drag to Applications folder and open
4. The app will install the `ollama` command line tool

Then pull the model:

```bash
ollama pull mistral
```

### Step 2: Set Up Python Environment

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the Application

**Option 1: One-command startup (Recommended)**

```bash
./run.sh
```

This script will:

- Check if Ollama is installed
- Create a virtual environment if needed
- Install Python dependencies
- Start Ollama service
- Download the Mistral model if not present
- Start the API server
- Launch the Streamlit web interface

**Option 2: Manual startup**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Make sure Ollama is running
ollama serve

# Terminal 2: Start the API (activate venv first)
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py

# Terminal 3: Start the UI (activate venv first)
source venv/bin/activate
streamlit run app.py
```

That's it! Open http://localhost:8501 and start uploading PDFs.

**Note**: The API runs on port 8080 by default. If you need to change it, update the port in both `main.py` and `app.py`.

## Available Models (All Free)

### For M3 with 8GB RAM:

- **Phi (2.7B)** - Fastest, good for simple Q&A
  ```bash
  ollama pull phi
  ```

  ```

## Performance Expectations

### Processing Speed (M3 Base Model - 8GB)

| PDF Size  | Model   | Processing Time | Q&A Response Time |
| --------- | ------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| 10 pages  | Phi     | 30-45 seconds   | 2-3 seconds       |
| 10 pages  | Mistral | 45-60 seconds   | 3-5 seconds       |
| 50 pages  | Phi     | 2-3 minutes     | 2-3 seconds       |
| 50 pages  | Mistral | 3-4 minutes     | 3-5 seconds       |
| 100 pages | Phi     | 5-7 minutes     | 3-4 seconds       |
| 100 pages | Mistral | 7-10 minutes    | 4-6 seconds       |

### Memory Usage

- **Idle**: ~500MB
- **PDF Processing**: 2-4GB
- **During Q&A**: 4-6GB (Mistral), 2-3GB (Phi)

## Optimizing for Your M3

### For 8GB Models (Base M3 Air)

Edit `.env`:

```bash
# Optimized for 8GB
LOCAL_LLM_MODEL=phi  # Smaller model
CHUNK_SIZE=500       # Smaller chunks
BATCH_SIZE=2         # Smaller batches
MAX_CONTEXT_LENGTH=1024
```

### For 16GB Models

Edit `.env`:

```bash
# Optimized for 16GB
LOCAL_LLM_MODEL=mistral
CHUNK_SIZE=1000
BATCH_SIZE=8
MAX_CONTEXT_LENGTH=4096
```

### For 24GB Models

Edit `.env`:

```bash
# Optimized for 24GB
LOCAL_LLM_MODEL=mixtral
CHUNK_SIZE=1500
BATCH_SIZE=16
MAX_CONTEXT_LENGTH=8192
```

## Tips for Best Performance

### 1. **Memory Management**

```bash
# Check available memory before processing large PDFs
# In Python:
import psutil
print(f"Available: {psutil.virtual_memory().available / (1024**3):.1f} GB")
```

### 2. **Model Preloading**

Keep Ollama running in the background:

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc for auto-start
alias ollama-start="ollama serve > /dev/null 2>&1 &"
```

### 3. **Batch Processing**

For multiple PDFs, process during low-usage times:

```python
# Process PDFs overnight
import schedule
schedule.every().day.at("22:00").do(process_pdfs)
```

### 4. **Use Activity Monitor**

- Monitor Memory Pressure
- Check if using Swap (should avoid)
- Ensure CPU isn't thermal throttling

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Ollama not running"

```bash
# Solution: Start Ollama
ollama serve

# Or run in background
nohup ollama serve > ollama.log 2>&1 &
```

### Issue: "Model too slow"

```bash
# Switch to smaller model
ollama pull phi
# Update .env: LOCAL_LLM_MODEL=phi
```

### Issue: "Out of memory"

```bash
# 1. Use smaller model
# 2. Reduce batch size in .env
# 3. Close other applications
# 4. Process smaller PDFs
```

### Issue: "Import errors"

```bash
# Ensure correct Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.9+

# Reinstall with Apple Silicon support
pip uninstall torch
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

### Issue: "Cannot connect to API server"

```bash
# Make sure the API is running
python main.py

# Or use the all-in-one script
./run.sh
```

### Issue: "Request timed out"

```bash
# Processing large PDFs can take time
# Try with a smaller PDF first
# Or increase timeout in app.py
```

## Advanced Optimizations

### 1. **GPU Acceleration**

The app automatically uses Metal Performance Shaders:

```python
# Verify MPS is available
import torch
print(torch.backends.mps.is_available())  # Should be True
```

### 2. **Parallel Processing**

```python
# In .env
NUM_THREADS=8  # M3 has 8 cores
```

### 3. **Custom Model Parameters**

```python
# For better quality (slower)
ollama run mistral --verbose \
  --parameter temperature 0.3 \
  --parameter top_p 0.9 \
  --parameter repeat_penalty 1.2
```

## Example Workflow

### 1. Research Papers

```bash
# Use mistral for academic content
LOCAL_LLM_MODEL=mistral
CHUNK_SIZE=1000  # Larger chunks for context

# Good questions:
"What methodology did the authors use?"
"What were the main findings?"
"What are the limitations of this study?"
```

### 2. Technical Documentation

```bash
# Use codellama for code-heavy docs
ollama pull codellama:7b
LOCAL_LLM_MODEL=codellama:7b

# Good questions:
"How do I configure the database?"
"Show me the API endpoints"
"What are the error codes?"
```

### 3. Books/Long Documents

```bash
# Use phi for speed on long docs
LOCAL_LLM_MODEL=phi
CHUNK_SIZE=800

# Good questions:
"Summarize chapter 3"
"What does the author say about X?"
"Find mentions of Y character"
```

## Limitations

### Understanding the Technology

This system uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, which means:
1. Your PDF is split into small chunks (~2000 characters each)
2. When you ask a question, it searches for the 5 most relevant chunks
3. Only those 5 chunks are given to the AI to formulate an answer
4. The AI never sees your entire document at once

Think of it as having a very smart assistant who can only look at 5 pages at a time from your document.

### What This System CAN Do Well ✅

| Document Type | Size | Use Cases | Success Rate |
|--------------|------|-----------|--------------|
| **Invoices** | 1-20 pages | Find totals, dates, line items | 95% |
| **Reports/Papers** | 10-50 pages | Extract findings, methodologies, conclusions | 85% |
| **Technical Docs** | 20-100 pages | Find specific procedures, configurations | 75% |
| **Contracts** | 5-30 pages | Locate specific clauses, terms | 80% |
| **Presentations** | 10-50 slides | Find specific information, data points | 85% |

**Best for:**
- ✅ Finding specific information (numbers, dates, names)
- ✅ Answering focused questions about particular sections
- ✅ Extracting data from structured documents
- ✅ Quick lookups and fact-finding
- ✅ Processing multiple separate documents

### What This System CANNOT Do Well ❌

| Document Type | Why It Struggles | What Happens |
|--------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Books/Novels** | Can't maintain narrative context across chapters | Gets random fragments, loses plot |
| **Legal Documents** | Can't cross-reference between distant sections | Misses important related clauses |
| **Academic Textbooks** | Can't build cumulative understanding | Treats each chunk in isolation |
| **Complex Manuals** | Can't follow multi-step procedures across pages | Loses sequence of steps |
| **Financial Reports** | Can't aggregate data from multiple tables | Sees fragments, not full picture |

**Not suitable for:**
- ❌ Understanding narrative or story progression
- ❌ Comprehensive document summarization
- ❌ Cross-referencing between distant sections
- ❌ Questions requiring whole-document context
- ❌ Complex calculations across multiple data points

### Practical Examples

#### ✅ Good Questions:
- "What is the invoice total?"
- "What methodology is described in section 3?"
- "What is the configuration for the database?"
- "When is the payment due date?"
- "What are the key findings on page 15?"

#### ❌ Poor Questions:
- "Summarize this entire book"
- "How does the character develop throughout the story?"
- "What are all the financial implications across all sections?"
- "Create a comprehensive summary of all chapters"
- "How do all the concepts in this textbook relate to each other?"

### Technical Constraints

1. **Context Window**: Only 4-8K tokens (roughly 5-10 pages) can be processed at once
2. **Chunk Isolation**: Each chunk is evaluated independently
3. **No Memory**: The system doesn't remember previous questions
4. **Local Model Limits**: 7-8B parameter models have limited reasoning compared to GPT-4/Claude

### Workarounds for Better Results

1. **For Books/Long Documents:**
   - Split into chapters and upload separately
   - Ask specific, located questions ("What happens in chapter 3?")
   - Use as a "smart search" tool rather than a comprehension tool

2. **For Complex Analysis:**
   - Break down complex questions into simple, specific ones
   - Reference specific sections ("What does section 4.2 say about...")
   - Upload related documents separately

3. **For Better Accuracy:**
   - Use more specific models (Llama 3 for general, DeepSeek Coder for technical)
   - Increase chunk size in .env for documents with longer passages
   - Ask the same question differently to verify answers

### When to Use Alternative Solutions

Consider cloud-based solutions (ChatGPT, Claude) when you need to:
- Analyze entire books or very long documents
- Understand complex relationships across a document
- Generate comprehensive summaries
- Perform analysis requiring full document context

This local solution excels at privacy, cost (free), and specific information extraction, but has inherent limitations due to the chunking approach and local model constraints.

## Privacy & Security

### What Stays Local:

- ✅ Your PDFs never leave your machine
- ✅ All processing happens on your M3
- ✅ No API keys needed
- ✅ No internet required after setup
- ✅ No usage tracking or telemetry

### Security Best Practices:

```bash
# 1. Encrypt sensitive PDFs at rest
# 2. Use FileVault on macOS
# 3. Don't expose ports publicly
# 4. Regular backups of vector stores
```

## Benchmarks on M3

### Real-World Tests (M3 Base 8GB):

| Task        | Mistral 7B | Phi 2.7B | Time Saved |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Load Model  | 5-7s       | 2-3s     | 60% faster |
| 10-page PDF | 45s        | 30s      | 33% faster |
| Simple Q&A  | 3-4s       | 1-2s     | 50% faster |
| Complex Q&A | 5-7s       | 3-4s     | 40% faster |
| Memory Used | 5-6GB      | 2-3GB    | 50% less   |

## Testing

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run all tests (excluding model tests)
make test-app

# Run only fast tests (skip slow image processing)
make test-fast

# Run specific test suites
make test-unit        # Unit tests only
make test-integration # Integration tests
make test-ui         # UI tests (Selenium)

# Test with coverage report
make test-coverage
```

### Testing Models
```bash
# Test specific models with various file formats
make test-models MODELS="mistral,llama3,deepseek"

# Quick model compatibility test
make test-models-quick
```

### Test Structure
- **Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated tests for individual components
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint and service interaction tests
- **UI Tests**: Selenium-based browser automation tests
- **Model Tests**: Comprehensive testing of different Ollama models

### Important Notes
1. **Services must be running**: Start with `make run` before testing
2. **Selenium tests**: Require Chrome/Chromium browser
3. **Model tests**: Require Ollama models to be downloaded
4. **Test data**: Located in `tests/fixtures/`

## Development & Styling

### CSS/SASS Build System
Greg uses a SASS-based styling system for maintainable, modular CSS:

```bash
# Build CSS once
make sass

# Watch for changes during development
make sass-watch  # (automatically runs with make run)

# Production build (compressed)
make sass-compressed
```

### Working with Styles
- **SASS Source**: `static/scss/` - All source SASS files
- **Compiled CSS**: `static/css/` - Auto-generated, gitignored
- **Component styles**: Each UI component has its own SCSS file
- **Design system**: Variables, mixins, and utilities for consistency

### Never use inline styles in Python - Use CSS classes instead:
```python
# Good ✅
st.markdown('<div class="chat-message">Hello</div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)

# Bad ❌
st.markdown('<div style="color: red;">Hello</div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

### Offline Mode Configuration
For completely offline operation without HuggingFace requests:

```bash
# Environment variables (automatically set)
export HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1
export TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1
export HF_DATASETS_OFFLINE=1

# Pre-download embedding models
make download-embeddings
```

## Next Steps

1. **Start Simple**: Use Phi for initial testing
2. **Quick Test**: Run `make test-quick` to verify all formats work
3. **Full Testing**: Run `make test` to compare all models across all formats
4. **Optimize**: Tune parameters based on test results
5. **Scale**: Add more models as needed
